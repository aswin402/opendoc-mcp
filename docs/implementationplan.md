## 6. Architecture

```
DOCX ──┐
PPTX ──┤
PDF  ──┤──▶  IR  ──▶  engine (search/replace/template/diff) ──▶  export
XLSX ──┤
HTML ──┤
MD/CSV─┘
```

Every format handler implements `load_to_ir()` (import) and `save_from_ir()` (export). The engine operates exclusively on IR, making all operations format-agnostic.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

| Level | Tool | Coverage Target |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Unit tests | `#[test]` | 80%+ of handler functions |
| Integration tests | `#[test]` | 100% of MCP tools |
| Benchmarks | `criterion` | Key operations (create, open, convert) |
| Doc tests | `#[doc]` | All public API examples |

---

## 8. Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| `rdocx` / `pptx` crate unmaintained | Low | High | Keep fork-ready; fallback crates |
| MCP spec changes | Medium | Medium | `rmcp` follows spec; bump on change |
| Performance regressions | Medium | Medium | Benchmark suite in CI |
| Rust compatibility | Low | Medium | MSRV pinning + `cargo deny` |
| Path injection / huge files | Medium | Medium | Security module + size limits |

---

## 9. Release Cadence

| Phase | Cadence | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| v0.0.x (Pre-alpha) | As needed | Bug fixes, polish |
| v0.1.x (Alpha) | Monthly | Major features |
| v1.0.0 (Stable) | — | Production readiness |
